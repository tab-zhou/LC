Issue:
    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the
    future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
    If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0ï¼Œ
Example:
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Solution:
    Method 1: traverse list for each element and the element after it, compare them and calculate the max different
    value. Algorithm Complexity: O(N * logN)
        for index_buy_day in range(0, max_day - 1):
            for index_sell_day in range(index_buy_day + 1, max_day):
